<h1> Canada </h1>
<hr>
<p>Canada is a country in North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific
    and
    northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the
    world's
    second-largest country by total area. Its southern and western border with the United States, stretching 8,891
    kilometres (5,525 mi),
    is the world's longest bi-national land border. Canada's capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan areas
    are Toronto,
    Montreal, and Vancouver.</p>

<p>Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th
    century,
    British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various
    armed conflicts,
    France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North
    American
    colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion
    of provinces
    and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. This widening autonomy was highlighted
    by the Statute
    of Westminster 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the
    Parliament
    of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. The country's head of
    government
    is the prime minister—who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of
    Commons—and
    is appointed by the governor general, representing the monarch, who serves as head of state. The country is a
    Commonwealth realm
    and is officially bilingual at the federal level. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of
    government transparency,
    civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse
    and multicultural
    nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries. Canada's long relationship with the
    United States has had
    a significant impact on its economy and culture.</p>

<p>A highly developed country, Canada has the seventeenth-highest nominal per-capita income globally and the
    sixteenth-highest
    ranking in the Human Development Index. Its advanced economy is the ninth-largest in the world, relying chiefly upon
    its
    abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is part of several major
    international
    and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations, NATO, the G7, the Group of Ten, the
    G20, the
    Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Commonwealth
    of Nations,
    the Arctic Council, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum,
    and the
    Organization of American States.</p>

<h3>Etymology</h3>
<hr>
<p>While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada, the name is now accepted as
    coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, meaning "village" or "settlement".[12] In 1535, Indigenous
    inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the
    village
    of Stadacona.[13] Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire
    area
    subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona);[13] by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this
    small
    region along the Saint Lawrence River as Canada.</p>

<p>From the 16th to the early 18th century, "Canada" referred to the part of New France that lay along the Saint
    Lawrence
    River.[14] In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada. These two colonies
    were
    collectively named the Canadas until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841.[15]</p>

<p>Upon Confederation in 1867, Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference, and
    the
    word Dominion was conferred as the country's title.[16] By the 1950s, the term Dominion of Canada was no longer used
    by
    the United Kingdom, which considered Canada a "Realm of the Commonwealth".[17] The government of Louis St. Laurent
    ended
    the practice of using Dominion in the statutes of Canada in 1951.[18][19]</p>

<p>The Canada Act 1982, which brought the constitution of Canada fully under Canadian control, referred only to Canada.
    Later that year, the name of the national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day.[20] The term Dominion
    was
    used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces, though after the Second World War the term federal
    had
    replaced dominion.[21]</p>

<h3>Indigenous peoples</h3>

<p>Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis,[22] the last being of mixed
    descent who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and subsequently
    developed their own identity.[22]</p>

<p>The first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering
    land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago.[23][24] The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats
    and
    Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada.[25] The characteristics of Indigenous
    societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks.[26][27]
    Some
    of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and
    have only been discovered through archeological investigations.[28]</p>

<p>The Indigenous population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000[29]
    and two million,[30] with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.[31] As a
    consequence of European colonization, the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent, and several
    First
    Nations, such as the Beothuk, disappeared.[32] The decline is attributed to several causes, including the transfer
    of
    European diseases, such as influenza, measles, and smallpox to which they had no natural immunity,[29][33] conflicts
    over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to
    settlers
    and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency.[34][35]</p>

<p>Although not without conflict, European Canadians' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were
    relatively peaceful.[36] First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of European
    colonies
    in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureur des bois and voyageurs in their explorations of
    the
    continent during the North American fur trade.[37] The Crown and Indigenous peoples began interactions during the
    European colonization period, though the Inuit, in general, had more limited interaction with European settlers.[38]
    However, from the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged Indigenous peoples to assimilate into their own
    culture.[39] These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and
    relocations.[40] A period of redress is underway, which started with the appointment of the Truth and Reconciliation
    Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.[41]</p>
<h3> European colonization</h3>
<p>It is believed that the first European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer Leif Erikson.[42][43]
    In
    approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small encampment that only lasted a few years at L'Anse aux Meadows on the
    northern tip of Newfoundland.[44] No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when Italian seafarer John
    Cabot
    explored and claimed Canada's Atlantic coast in the name of King Henry VII of England.[45] In 1534, French explorer
    Jacques Cartier explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where, on July 24, he planted a 10-metre (33 ft) cross bearing
    the
    words "Long Live the King of France" and took possession of the territory New France in the name of King Francis
    I.[46]
    The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the Basque and Portuguese
    establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast.[47] In general, early settlements during
    the
    Age of Discovery appear to have been short-lived due to a combination of the harsh climate, problems with navigating
    trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia.[48][49]</p>

<p>In 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I, founded St. John's, Newfoundland, as
    the
    first North American English seasonal camp.[50] In 1600, the French established their first seasonal trading post at
    Tadoussac along the Saint Lawrence.[44] French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the
    first
    permanent year-round European settlements at Port Royal (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608).[51] Among the colonists
    of
    New France, Canadiens extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present-day
    Maritimes, while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi
    watershed to Louisiana.[52] The Beaver Wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North American fur
    trade.[53]</p>

<p>The English established additional settlements in Newfoundland, beginning in 1610 and the Thirteen Colonies to the
    south
    were founded soon after.[54][55] A series of four wars erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763; the
    later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War.[56] Mainland Nova Scotia
    came
    under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in
    1763
    after the Seven Years' War.[57]</p>
<h3>British North America</h3>
<p>The Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights, created the Province of Quebec out of New
    France,
    and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia.[20] St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate
    colony
    in 1769.[58] To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act 1774, expanding Quebec's
    territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.[59] More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy
    and
    rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British
    rule.[60]
    It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an
    independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies.[61] The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered
    many
    residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American
    Revolution.[20]</p>

<P>After the successful American War of Independence, the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized the independence of the newly
    formed United States and set the terms of peace, ceding British North American territories south of the Great Lakes
    and
    east of the Mississippi River to the new country.[62] The American war of independence also caused a large
    out-migration
    of Loyalists, the settlers who had fought against American independence. Many moved to Canada, particularly Atlantic
    Canada, where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. New Brunswick was in
    turn
    split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes, which led to the
    incorporation of Saint John, New Brunswick, as Canada's first city.[63] To accommodate the influx of
    English-speaking
    Loyalists in Central Canada, the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province of Canada into French-speaking
    Lower
    Canada (later Quebec) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later Ontario), granting each its own elected legislative
    assembly.[64]</P>

    Dams
    The Canadas were the main front in the War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom. Peace came in
    1815;
    no boundaries were changed.[65] Immigration resumed at a higher level, with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain
    between
    1815 and 1850.[66] New arrivals included refugees escaping the Great Irish Famine as well as Gaelic-speaking Scots
    displaced by the Highland Clearances.[67] Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who
    immigrated to Canada before 1891.[29]</p>

<p>The desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive Rebellions of 1837.[68] The Durham Report subsequently
    recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture.[20] The Act of
    Union
    1840 merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all
    provinces of
    British North America east of Lake Superior by 1855.[69] The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United
    States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. This paved
    the
    way for British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858).[70] The Anglo-Russian Treaty of
    Saint Petersburg (1825) established the border along the Pacific coast, but, even after the US Alaska Purchase of
    1867,
    disputes continued about the exact demarcation of the Alaska–Yukon and Alaska–BC border.[71]</p>
<h3>Confederation and expansion</h3>
<p>Following several constitutional conferences, the British North America Act 1867 officially proclaimed Canadian
    Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New
    Brunswick.[72][73]
    Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories, where the
    Métis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870.[74]
    British
    Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a
    transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years,[75] while Prince Edward Island
    joined in
    1873.[76] In 1898, during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories, Parliament created the Yukon
    Territory.
    Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905.[76] Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the Canadian
    population emigrated southwards, to the U.S.[77]</p>

<p>To open the West and encourage European immigration, Parliament approved sponsoring the construction of three
    transcontinental railways (including the Canadian Pacific Railway), opening the prairies to settlement with the
    Dominion
    Lands Act, and establishing the North-West Mounted Police to assert its authority over this territory.[78][79] This
    period of westward expansion and nation building resulted in the displacement of many Indigenous peoples of the
    Canadian
    Prairies to "Indian reserves",[80] clearing the way for ethnic European block settlements.[81] This caused the
    collapse
    of the Plains Bison in western Canada and the introduction of European cattle farms and wheat fields dominating the
    land.[82] The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their
    traditional
    hunting lands.[83] The federal government did provide emergency relief, on condition of the Indigenous peoples
    moving to
    the reserves.[84] During this time, Canada introduced the Indian Act extending its control over the First Nations to
    education, government and legal rights.[85]</p>


<h3>Early 20th century</h3>
<p>Because Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the British North America Act, 1867, its
    declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into World War I.[86] Volunteers sent to the Western Front
    later
    became part of the Canadian Corps, which played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major
    engagements of the war.[87] Out of approximately 625,000 Canadians who served in World War I, some 60,000 were
    killed
    and another 172,000 were wounded.[88] The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when the Unionist Cabinet's proposal
    to
    augment the military's dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from
    French-speaking Quebecers.[89] The Military Service Act brought in compulsory military service, though it, coupled
    with
    disputes over French language schools outside Quebec, deeply alienated Francophone Canadians and temporarily split
    the
    Liberal Party.[89] In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain,[87] and the Statute of
    Westminster 1931 affirmed Canada's independence.[90]</p>

<p>The Great Depression in Canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the
    country.[91] In response to the downturn, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced
    many
    elements of a welfare state (as pioneered by Tommy Douglas) in the 1940s and 1950s.[92] On the advice of Prime
    Minister
    William Lyon Mackenzie King, war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI, seven
    days
    after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence.[87]</p>

<p>The first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939. In all, over a million Canadians served in the
    armed
    forces during World War II and approximately 42,000 were killed and another 55,000 were wounded.[93] Canadian troops
    played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid, the Allied invasion of
    Italy, the Normandy landings, the Battle of Normandy, and the Battle of the Scheldt in 1944.[87] Canada provided
    asylum
    for the Dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to
    its
    liberation from Nazi Germany.[94]</p>

<p>The Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for Canada, Britain,
    China,
    and the Soviet Union.[87] Despite another Conscription Crisis in Quebec in 1944, Canada finished the war with a
    large
    army and strong economy.[95]</p>
<h3>Contemporary era</h3>
<p>The financial crisis of the Great Depression had led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible
    government
    in 1934 and become a Crown colony ruled by a British governor.[96] After two referendums, Newfoundlanders voted to
    join
    Canada in 1949 as a province.[97]</p>

<p>Canada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence
    of
    a new Canadian identity, marked by the adoption of the Maple Leaf Flag in 1965,[98] the implementation of official
    bilingualism (English and French) in 1969,[99] and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971.[100]
    Socially
    democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans,
    though
    provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their
    jurisdictions.[101]</p>

<p>refer to caption
    A copy of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
    Finally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the UK's Canada Act 1982, the patriation of
    Canada's
    constitution from the United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
    Freedoms.[102][103][104] Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country, although the monarch
    is
    retained as sovereign.[105][106] In 1999, Nunavut became Canada's third territory after a series of negotiations
    with
    the federal government.[107]</p>

<p>At the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s,
    giving birth to a secular nationalist movement.[108] The radical Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) ignited the
    October
    Crisis with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970[109] and the sovereignist Parti Québécois was elected in
    1976,
    organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism
    constitutionally through the Meech Lake Accord failed in 1990.[110] This led to the formation of the Bloc Québécois
    in
    Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West.[111][112] A second referendum followed in
    1995,
    in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent.[113] In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled
    unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional and the Clarity Act was passed by parliament, outlining
    the
    terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation.[110]</p>

<p>In addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and
    early
    1990s. These included the explosion of Air India Flight 182 in 1985, the largest mass murder in Canadian
    history;[114]
    the École Polytechnique massacre in 1989, a university shooting targeting female students;[115] and the Oka Crisis
    of
    1990,[116] the first of a number of violent confrontations between the government and Indigenous groups.[117] Canada
    also joined the Gulf War in 1990 as part of a United States–led coalition force and was active in several
    peacekeeping
    missions in the 1990s, including the UNPROFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia.[118] Canada sent troops to
    Afghanistan
    in 2001 but declined to join the United States–led invasion of Iraq in 2003.[119]</p>

<p>In 2011, Canadian forces participated in the NATO-led intervention into the Libyan Civil War,[120] and also became
    involved in battling the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq in the mid-2010s.[121] The COVID-19 pandemic in Canada
    began
    on January 27, 2020, with wide social and economic disruption.[122] In 2021, the remains of hundreds of Indigenous
    people were discovered near the former sites of Canadian Indian residential schools.[123] Administered by the
    Canadian
    Catholic Church and funded by the Canadian government from 1828 to 1997, these boarding schools attempted to
    assimilate
    Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian culture.[124]</p>

<h3>Biodiversity</h3>
<p>Canada is divided into fifteen terrestrial and five marine ecozones.[136] These ecozones encompass over 80,000
    classified species of Canadian wildlife, with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered.[137] Due
    to human activities, invasive species and environmental issues in the country, there are currently more than 800
    species at risk of being lost.[138] Over half of Canada's landscape is intact and relatively free of human
    development.[139] The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on Earth, with
    approximately 3,000,000 km2 (1,200,000 sq mi) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry.[140] Since the end of the
    last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions,[141] with 42 percent of its land area
    covered by forests (approximately 8 percent of the world's forested land).[142]</p>
<p>Approximately 12.1 percent of the nation's landmass and freshwater are conservation areas, including 11.4 percent
    designated as protected areas.[143] Approximately 13.8 percent of its territorial waters are conserved, including
    8.9 percent designated as protected areas.[143] Canada's first National Park, Banff National Park established in
    1885, spans 6,641 square kilometres (2,564 sq mi)[144] of mountainous terrain, with many glaciers and ice fields,
    dense coniferous forest, and alpine landscapes.[145] Canada's oldest provincial park, Algonquin Provincial Park
    established in 1893, covers an area of 7,653.45 square kilometres (2,955.01 sq mi) is dominated by old-growth forest
    with over 2,400 lakes and 1,200 kilometres of streams and rivers.[146] Lake Superior National Marine Conservation
    Area is the world's largest freshwater protected area spanning roughly 10,000 square kilometres (3,900 sq mi) of
    lakebed, its overlaying freshwater, and associated shoreline on 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi) of islands and
    mainland's.[147] Canada's largest national wildlife region is the Scott Islands Marine National Wildlife Area, which
    spans 11,570.65 square kilometres (4,467.45 sq mi),[148] protects critical breeding and nesting habitat for over 40
    percent of British Columbia's seabirds.[149] Canada's 18 UNESCO Biosphere Reserves cover a total area of 235,000
    square kilometres (91,000 sq mi).[150]</p>
<h3>Climate</h3>
<p>Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many
    parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate,
    where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe wind
    chills.[151] In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of
    the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy
    winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while
    between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in
    some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F).[152]</p>
<p>Much of Northern Canada is covered by ice and permafrost; however, the future of the permafrost is uncertain because
    the Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of climate change in Canada.[153] Canada's
    annual average temperature over land has warmed by 1.7 °C (3.1 °F), with changes ranging from 1.1 to 2.3 °C (2.0 to
    4.1 °F) in various regions, since 1948.[154] The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in the
    Prairies.[154] In the southern regions of Canada, air pollution from both Canada and the United States—caused by
    metal smelting, burning coal to power utilities, and vehicle emissions—has resulted in acid rain, which has severely
    impacted waterways, forest growth and agricultural productivity in Canada.<sup>[155]</sup></p>
