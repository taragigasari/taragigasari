    <p><b>Canada</b> is a country in North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to
        the
        Pacific
        and
        northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres <i>(3.85 million square miles)</i>,
        making
        it the
        world's
        second-largest country by total area. Its southern and western border with the United States, stretching 8,891
        kilometres (5,525 mi),
        is the world's longest bi-national land border. Canada's capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan
        areas
        are Toronto,
        Montreal, and Vancouver.</p>

    <p>Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th
        century,
        British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various
        armed conflicts,
        France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North
        American
        colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an
        accretion
        of provinces
        and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. This widening autonomy was
        highlighted
        by the Statute
        of Westminster 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the
        Parliament
        of the United Kingdom.</p>

    <p>Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. The country's
        head of
        government
        is the prime minister—who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House
        of
        Commons—and
        is appointed by the governor general, representing the monarch, who serves as head of state. The country is a
        Commonwealth realm
        and is officially bilingual at the federal level. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of
        government transparency,
        civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. It is one of the world's most ethnically
        diverse
        and multicultural
        nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries. Canada's long relationship with the
        United States has had
        a significant impact on its economy and culture.</p>

    <p>A highly developed country, Canada has the seventeenth-highest nominal per-capita income globally and the
        sixteenth-highest
        ranking in the Human Development Index. Its advanced economy is the ninth-largest in the world, relying chiefly
        upon
        its
        abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is part of several major
        international
        and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations, NATO, the G7, the Group of Ten,
        the
        G20, the
        Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (<abbr>OECD</abbr>), the World Trade Organization (
        <abrr>WTO</abrr>
        ), the Commonwealth
        of Nations,
        the Arctic Council, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
        forum,
        and the
        Organization of American States.

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_of_Canada" target="_blank">Name of Canada</a>
    <br>
    <p>While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada, the name is now accepted
        as
        coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, meaning <cite>"village"</cite> or
        <cite>"settlement"</cite>.<sup>[12]</sup> In 1535, Indigenous
        inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the
        village
        of Stadacona.<sup>[13]</sup> Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village but
        to
        the entire
        area
        subject to Donnacona <cite>(the chief at Stadacona)</cite>;<sup>[13]</sup> by 1545, European books and maps had
        begun referring to this
        small
        region along the Saint Lawrence River as Canada.</p>

    <p>From the 16th to the early 18th century, "Canada" referred to the part of New France that lay along the Saint
        Lawrence
        River.<sup>[14]</sup> In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada. These
        two
        colonies
        were
        collectively named the Canadas until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841.<sup>[15]</sup></p>

    <p>Upon Confederation in 1867, Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference,
        and
        the
        word Dominion was conferred as the country's title.<sup>[16]</sup> By the 1950s, the term Dominion of Canada was
        no
        longer used
        by
        the United Kingdom, which considered Canada a <cite>"Realm of the Commonwealth"</cite>.<sup>[17]</sup> The
        government of Louis St. Laurent
        ended
        the practice of using Dominion in the statutes of Canada in 1951.<sup>[18]</sup> <sup>[19]</sup></p>

    <p>The Canada Act 1982, which brought the constitution of Canada fully under Canadian control, referred only to
        Canada.
        Later that year, the name of the national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day.<sup>[20]</sup>
        The
        term Dominion
        was
        used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces, though after the Second World War the term
        federal
        had
        replaced dominion.<sup>[21]</sup></p>

         alt="Linguistic areas of North American Indigenous peoples at the time of European contact">

    <p>Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis,<sup>[22]</sup> the last
        being
        of mixed
        descent who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and
        subsequently
        developed their own identity.<sup>[22]</sup></p>

    <p>The first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the
        Bering
        land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago.<sup>[23]</sup><sup>[24]</sup> The Paleo-Indian archeological
        sites at Old Crow Flats
        and
        Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada.<sup>[25]</sup>The characteristics of
        Indigenous
        societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading
        networks.<sup>[26]</sup><sup>[27]</sup>
        Some
        of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries
        and
        have only been discovered through archeological investigations.<sup>[28]</sup></p>

    <p>The Indigenous population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between
        200,000<sup>[29]</sup>
        and two million,<sup>[30]</sup> with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal
        Peoples.<sup>[31]</sup>
        As a
        consequence of European colonization, the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent, and several
        First
        Nations, such as the Beothuk, disappeared.<sup>[32]</sup> The decline is attributed to several causes, including
        the
        transfer
        of
        European diseases, such as influenza, measles, and smallpox to which they had no natural
        immunity,<sup>[29]</sup><sup>[33]</sup>
        conflicts
        over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to
        settlers
        and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency.<sup>[34]</sup><sup>[35]</sup></p>

    <p>Although not without conflict, European Canadians' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations
        were
        relatively peaceful.<sup>[36]</sup> First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of
        European
        colonies
        in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureur des bois and voyageurs in their
        explorations of
        the
        continent during the North American fur trade.<sup>[37]</sup> The Crown and Indigenous peoples began
        interactions during
        the
        European colonization period, though the Inuit, in general, had more limited interaction with European
        settlers.<sup>[38]</sup>
        However, from the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged Indigenous peoples to assimilate into their
        own
        culture.<sup>[39]</sup> These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced
        integration
        and
        relocations.<sup>[40]</sup> A period of redress is underway, which started with the appointment of the Truth and
        Reconciliation
        Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.<sup>[41]</sup></p>
    <h3 id="EuropeanColonization"> European colonization</h3>
    <p>It is believed that the first European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer Leif
        Erikson.[42][43]
        In
        approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small encampment that only lasted a few years at L'Anse aux Meadows on
        the
        northern tip of Newfoundland.[44] No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when Italian seafarer
        John
        Cabot
        explored and claimed Canada's Atlantic coast in the name of King Henry VII of England.[45] In 1534, French
        explorer
        Jacques Cartier explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where, on July 24, he planted a 10-metre (33 ft) cross
        bearing
        the
        words "Long Live the King of France" and took possession of the territory New France in the name of King Francis
        I.[46]
        The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the Basque and Portuguese
        establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast.[47] In general, early settlements
        during
        the
        Age of Discovery appear to have been short-lived due to a combination of the harsh climate, problems with
        navigating
        trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia.[48][49]</p>

    <p>In 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I, founded St. John's, Newfoundland,
        as
        the
        first North American English seasonal camp.[50] In 1600, the French established their first seasonal trading
        post at
        Tadoussac along the Saint Lawrence.[44] French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the
        first
        permanent year-round European settlements at Port Royal (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608).[51] Among the
        colonists
        of
        New France, Canadiens extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present-day
        Maritimes, while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi
        watershed to Louisiana.[52] The Beaver Wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North American
        fur
        trade.[53]</p>

    <p>The English established additional settlements in Newfoundland, beginning in 1610 and the Thirteen Colonies to
        the
        south
        were founded soon after.[54][55] A series of four wars erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763;
        the
        later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War.[56] Mainland Nova
        Scotia
        came
        under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in
        1763
        after the Seven Years' War.[57]</p>

         alt="Benjamin West's The Death of General Wolfe (1771) dramatizes James Wolfe's death during the Battle of the Plains of Abraham at Quebec.">
    <p>The Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights, created the Province of Quebec out of New
        France,
        and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia.[20] St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a
        separate
        colony
        in 1769.[58] To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act 1774, expanding Quebec's
        territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.[59] More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special
        autonomy
        and
        rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British
        rule.[60]
        It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an
        independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies.[61] The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn
        angered
        many
        residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American
        Revolution.[20]</p>

    <P>After the successful American War of Independence, the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized the independence of the
        newly
        formed United States and set the terms of peace, ceding British North American territories south of the Great
        Lakes
        and
        east of the Mississippi River to the new country.[62] The American war of independence also caused a large
        out-migration
        of Loyalists, the settlers who had fought against American independence. Many moved to Canada, particularly
        Atlantic
        Canada, where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. New Brunswick was
        in
        turn
        split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes, which led to the
        incorporation of Saint John, New Brunswick, as Canada's first city.[63] To accommodate the influx of
        English-speaking
        Loyalists in Central Canada, the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province of Canada into French-speaking
        Lower
        Canada (later Quebec) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later Ontario), granting each its own elected
        legislative
        assembly.[64]</P>

        The Canadas were the main front in the War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom. Peace came
        in
        1815;
        no boundaries were changed.[65] Immigration resumed at a higher level, with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain
        between
        1815 and 1850.[66] New arrivals included refugees escaping the Great Irish Famine as well as Gaelic-speaking
        Scots
        displaced by the Highland Clearances.[67] Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who
        immigrated to Canada before 1891.[29]</p>

    <p>The desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive Rebellions of 1837.[68] The Durham Report
        subsequently
        recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture.[20] The Act of
        Union
        1840 merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all
        provinces of
        British North America east of Lake Superior by 1855.[69] The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the
        United
        States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. This
        paved
        the
        way for British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858).[70] The Anglo-Russian Treaty
        of
        Saint Petersburg (1825) established the border along the Pacific coast, but, even after the US Alaska Purchase
        of
        1867,
        disputes continued about the exact demarcation of the Alaska–Yukon and Alaska–BC border.[71]</p>
    <h3 id="ConfederationAndExpansion">Confederation and expansion</h3>
    <p>Following several constitutional conferences, the British North America Act 1867 officially proclaimed Canadian
        Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New
        Brunswick.[72][73]
        Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories, where
        the
        Métis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870.[74]
        British
        Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of
        a
        transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years,[75] while Prince Edward Island
        joined in
        1873.[76] In 1898, during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories, Parliament created the Yukon
        Territory.
        Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905.[76] Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the Canadian
        population emigrated southwards, to the U.S.[77]</p>

    <p>To open the West and encourage European immigration, Parliament approved sponsoring the construction of three
        transcontinental railways (including the Canadian Pacific Railway), opening the prairies to settlement with the
        Dominion
        Lands Act, and establishing the North-West Mounted Police to assert its authority over this territory.[78][79]
        This
        period of westward expansion and nation building resulted in the displacement of many Indigenous peoples of the
        Canadian
        Prairies to "Indian reserves",[80] clearing the way for ethnic European block settlements.[81] This caused the
        collapse
        of the Plains Bison in western Canada and the introduction of European cattle farms and wheat fields dominating
        the
        land.[82] The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their
        traditional
        hunting lands.[83] The federal government did provide emergency relief, on condition of the Indigenous peoples
        moving to
        the reserves.[84] During this time, Canada introduced the Indian Act extending its control over the First
        Nations to
        education, government and legal rights.[85]</p>


    <h3 id="Early20thCentury">Early 20th century</h3>
    <p>Because Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the British North America Act, 1867,
        its
        declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into World War I.[86] Volunteers sent to the Western
        Front
        later
        became part of the Canadian Corps, which played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major
        engagements of the war.[87] Out of approximately 625,000 Canadians who served in World War I, some 60,000 were
        killed
        and another 172,000 were wounded.[88] The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when the Unionist Cabinet's
        proposal
        to
        augment the military's dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections
        from
        French-speaking Quebecers.[89] The Military Service Act brought in compulsory military service, though it,
        coupled
        with
        disputes over French language schools outside Quebec, deeply alienated Francophone Canadians and temporarily
        split
        the
        Liberal Party.[89] In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain,[87] and the Statute of
        Westminster 1931 affirmed Canada's independence.[90]</p>

    <p>The Great Depression in Canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the
        country.[91] In response to the downturn, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan
        introduced
        many
        elements of a welfare state (as pioneered by Tommy Douglas) in the 1940s and 1950s.[92] On the advice of Prime
        Minister
        William Lyon Mackenzie King, war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI,
        seven
        days
        after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence.[87]</p>

    <p>The first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939. In all, over a million Canadians served in the
        armed
        forces during World War II and approximately 42,000 were killed and another 55,000 were wounded.[93] Canadian
        troops
        played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid, the Allied
        invasion of
        Italy, the Normandy landings, the Battle of Normandy, and the Battle of the Scheldt in 1944.[87] Canada provided
        asylum
        for the Dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major
        contributions to
        its
        liberation from Nazi Germany.[94]</p>

    <p>The Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for Canada, Britain,
        China,
        and the Soviet Union.[87] Despite another Conscription Crisis in Quebec in 1944, Canada finished the war with a
        large
        army and strong economy.[95]</p>
    <h3 id="ContemporaryEra">Contemporary era</h3>
    <p>The financial crisis of the Great Depression had led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible
        government
        in 1934 and become a Crown colony ruled by a British governor.[96] After two referendums, Newfoundlanders voted
        to
        join
        Canada in 1949 as a province.[97]</p>

    <p>Canada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the
        emergence
        of
        a new Canadian identity, marked by the adoption of the Maple Leaf Flag in 1965,[98] the implementation of
        official
        bilingualism (English and French) in 1969,[99] and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971.[100]
        Socially
        democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans,
        though
        provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their
        jurisdictions.[101]</p>

    <p>refer to caption
        A copy of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
        Finally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the UK's Canada Act 1982, the patriation of
        Canada's
        constitution from the United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
        Freedoms.[102][103][104] Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country, although the
        monarch
        is
        retained as sovereign.[105][106] In 1999, Nunavut became Canada's third territory after a series of negotiations
        with
        the federal government.[107]</p>

    <p>At the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the Quiet Revolution of the
        1960s,
        giving birth to a secular nationalist movement.[108] The radical Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) ignited the
        October
        Crisis with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970[109] and the sovereignist Parti Québécois was elected
        in
        1976,
        organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec
        nationalism
        constitutionally through the Meech Lake Accord failed in 1990.[110] This led to the formation of the Bloc
        Québécois
        in
        Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West.[111][112] A second referendum followed in
        1995,
        in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent.[113] In 1997, the Supreme Court
        ruled
        unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional and the Clarity Act was passed by parliament,
        outlining
        the
        terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation.[110]</p>

    <p>In addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and
        early
        1990s. These included the explosion of Air India Flight 182 in 1985, the largest mass murder in Canadian
        history;[114]
        the École Polytechnique massacre in 1989, a university shooting targeting female students;[115] and the Oka
        Crisis
        of
        1990,[116] the first of a number of violent confrontations between the government and Indigenous groups.[117]
        Canada
        also joined the Gulf War in 1990 as part of a United States–led coalition force and was active in several
        peacekeeping
        missions in the 1990s, including the UNPROFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia.[118] Canada sent troops to
        Afghanistan
        in 2001 but declined to join the United States–led invasion of Iraq in 2003.[119]</p>

    <p>In 2011, Canadian forces participated in the NATO-led intervention into the Libyan Civil War,[120] and also
        became
        involved in battling the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq in the mid-2010s.[121] The COVID-19 pandemic in Canada
        began
        on January 27, 2020, with wide social and economic disruption.[122] In 2021, the remains of hundreds of
        Indigenous
        people were discovered near the former sites of Canadian Indian residential schools.[123] Administered by the
        Canadian
        Catholic Church and funded by the Canadian government from 1828 to 1997, these boarding schools attempted to
        assimilate
        Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian culture.[124]</p>

    <p>Canada is divided into fifteen terrestrial and five marine ecozones.[136] These ecozones encompass over 80,000
        classified species of Canadian wildlife, with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered.[137]
        Due
        to human activities, invasive species and environmental issues in the country, there are currently more than 800
        species at risk of being lost.[138] Over half of Canada's landscape is intact and relatively free of human
        development.[139] The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on Earth, with
        approximately 3,000,000 km2 (1,200,000 sq mi) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry.[140] Since the end of
        the
        last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions,[141] with 42 percent of its land
        area
        covered by forests (approximately 8 percent of the world's forested land).[142]</p>
    <p>Approximately 12.1 percent of the nation's landmass and freshwater are conservation areas, including 11.4 percent
        designated as protected areas.[143] Approximately 13.8 percent of its territorial waters are conserved,
        including
        8.9 percent designated as protected areas.[143] Canada's first National Park, Banff National Park established in
        1885, spans 6,641 square kilometres (2,564 sq mi)[144] of mountainous terrain, with many glaciers and ice
        fields,
        dense coniferous forest, and alpine landscapes.[145] Canada's oldest provincial park, Algonquin Provincial Park
        established in 1893, covers an area of 7,653.45 square kilometres (2,955.01 sq mi) is dominated by old-growth
        forest
        with over 2,400 lakes and 1,200 kilometres of streams and rivers.[146] Lake Superior National Marine
        Conservation
        Area is the world's largest freshwater protected area spanning roughly 10,000 square kilometres (3,900 sq mi) of
        lakebed, its overlaying freshwater, and associated shoreline on 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi) of islands and
        mainland's.[147] Canada's largest national wildlife region is the Scott Islands Marine National Wildlife Area,
        which
        spans 11,570.65 square kilometres (4,467.45 sq mi),[148] protects critical breeding and nesting habitat for over
        40
        percent of British Columbia's seabirds.[149] Canada's 18 UNESCO Biosphere Reserves cover a total area of 235,000
        square kilometres (91,000 sq mi).[150]</p>
    <h3 id="Climate">Climate</h3>
    <p>Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region. Winters can be harsh in
        many
        parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental
        climate,
        where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe wind
        chills.[151] In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts
        of
        the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy
        winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while
        between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures
        in
        some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F).[152]</p>
    <p>Much of Northern Canada is covered by ice and permafrost; however, the future of the permafrost is uncertain
        because
        the Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of climate change in Canada.[153]
        Canada's
        annual average temperature over land has warmed by 1.7 °C (3.1 °F), with changes ranging from 1.1 to 2.3 °C (2.0
        to
        4.1 °F) in various regions, since 1948.[154] The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in the
        Prairies.[154] In the southern regions of Canada, air pollution from both Canada and the United States—caused by
        metal smelting, burning coal to power utilities, and vehicle emissions—has resulted in acid rain, which has
        severely
        impacted waterways, forest growth and agricultural productivity in Canada.<sup>[155]</sup></p>

    <p>The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country, and consists of written text and unwritten
        conventions.<sup>[196]</sup> The Constitution Act, 1867 <cite>(known as the British North America Act prior to
            1982)</cite>, affirmed governance
        based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial
        governments.<sup>[197]</sup>
        The Statute of
        Westminster 1931 granted full autonomy, and the Constitution Act, 1982 ended all legislative ties to Britain, as
        well as
        adding a constitutional amending formula and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.<sup>[198]</sup> The
        Charter guarantees
        basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be over-ridden by any government—though a notwithstanding clause
        allows
        Parliament and the provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the Charter for a period of five
        years.<sup>[199]</sup></p>

        Canada's judiciary plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down Acts of

        that
        violate the constitution. The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court and final arbiter and has been led
        since
        December 18, 2017, by Richard Wagner, the chief justice of Canada.<sup>[200]</sup> Its nine members are
        appointed by
        the governor
        general on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice. All judges at the superior and appellate
        levels
        are

    <p>Common law prevails everywhere except in Quebec, where civil law predominates.[202] Criminal law is solely a
        federal
        responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada.[203] Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is officially
        a
        provincial responsibility, conducted by provincial and municipal police forces.[204] However, in most rural
        areas
        and
        some urban areas, policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted
        Police.[205]</p>

    <p>Canadian Aboriginal law provides certain constitutionally recognized rights to land and traditional practices for
        Indigenous groups in Canada.[206] Various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations between
        Europeans
        and many Indigenous peoples.[207] Most notably, a series of eleven treaties known as the Numbered Treaties were
        signed
        between the Indigenous peoples and the reigning monarch of Canada between 1871 and 1921.[208] These treaties are
        agreements between the Canadian Crown-in-Council with the duty to consult and accommodate.[209] The role of
        Aboriginal
        law and the rights they support were reaffirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.[207] These rights
        may
        include provision of services, such as health care through the Indian Health Transfer Policy, and exemption from
        taxation.[210]</p>

    <p> Canada is recognized as a middle power for its role in international affairs with a tendency to pursue
        multilateral
        solutions.[211] Canada's foreign policy based on international peacekeeping and security is carried out through
        coalitions and international organizations, and through the work of numerous federal institutions.[212][213]
        Canada's peacekeeping role during the 20th century has played a major role in its global image.[214][215] The
        strategy of the Canadian government's foreign aid policy reflects an emphasis to meet the Millennium Development
        Goals, while also providing assistance in response to foreign humanitarian crises.[216]</p>

    <p> Canada was a founding member of the United Nations and has membership in the World Trade Organization, the G20
        and
        the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).[211] Canada is also a member of various other
        international and regional organizations and forums for economic and cultural affairs.[217] Canada acceded to
        the
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1976.[218] Canada joined the Organization of American
        States
        (OAS) in 1990 and hosted the OAS General Assembly in 2000 and the 3rd Summit of the Americas in 2001.[219]
        Canada

    <p> Canada and the United States share the world's longest undefended border, co-operate on military campaigns and
        exercises, and are each other's largest trading partner.[221][222] Canada nevertheless has an independent
        foreign
        policy, most notably maintaining full relations with Cuba, and declining to officially participate in the 2003
        invasion of Iraq.[223] Canada also maintains historic ties to the United Kingdom and France and to other former
        British and French colonies through Canada's membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organisation
        internationale de la Francophonie.[224] Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands,
        owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during World War II.[94]</p>

    <p>Canada's strong attachment to the British Empire and Commonwealth led to major participation in British military
        efforts in the Second Boer War, World War I and World War II.[225] Since then, Canada has been an advocate for
        multilateralism, making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations.[226][227] During
        the
        Cold War, Canada was a major contributor to UN forces in the Korean War and founded the North American Aerospace
        Defense Command (NORAD) in cooperation with the United States to defend against potential aerial attacks from
        the
        Soviet Union.[228]</p>

    <p>During the Suez Crisis of 1956, future prime minister Lester B. Pearson eased tensions by proposing the inception
        of
        the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, for which he was awarded the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize.[229] As this was the
        first UN peacekeeping mission, Pearson is often credited as the inventor of the concept.[230] Canada has since
        served in over 50 peacekeeping missions, including every UN peacekeeping effort until 1989,[87] and has since
        maintained forces in international missions in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, and elsewhere; Canada has
        sometimes
        faced controversy over its involvement in foreign countries, notably in the 1993 Somalia affair.[231]</p>

    <p> In 2001, Canada deployed troops to Afghanistan as part of the U.S. stabilization force and the UN-authorized,
        NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.[232] In February 2007, Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom,
        Norway,
        and Russia announced their joint commitment to a $1.5-billion project to help develop vaccines for developing
        nations, and called on other countries to join them.[233] In August 2007, Canada's territorial claims in the
        Arctic
        were challenged after a Russian underwater expedition to the North Pole; Canada has considered that area to be
        sovereign territory since 1925.[234] In September 2020, Canada joined the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access
        (COVAX)
        program, which aims to ensure equal access to a potential COVID-19 vaccine for all member countries and to help
        lower-income countries secure doses.[235]</p>

    <p>The nation employs a professional, volunteer military force of approximately 79,000 active personnel and 32,250
        reserve personnel.[236] The unified Canadian Forces (CF) comprise the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy, and
        Royal
        Canadian Air Force. In 2013, Canada's military expenditure totalled approximately CA$19 billion, or around one
        percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).[237][238] Following the 2016 Defence Policy Review,
        called
        "Strong, Secure, Engaged", the Canadian government announced a 70 percent increase to the country's defence
        budget
        over the next decade.[239] The Canadian Forces will acquire 88 fighter planes and 15 naval surface combatants
        based
        on the Type 26 frigate design, the latter as part of the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy.[240][241]
        Canada's total military expenditure is expected to reach CA$32.7 billion by 2027.[242] Canada's military
        currently
        has over 3000 personnel deployed overseas, including in Iraq, Ukraine, and the Caribbean Sea.[243]</p>

    <p> Canada is a federation composed of ten provinces and three territories. In turn, these may be grouped into four
        main
        regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (Eastern Canada refers to Central
        Canada and Atlantic Canada together).[244] Provinces have more autonomy than territories, having responsibility
        for
        social programs such as health care, education, and welfare.[245] Together, the provinces collect more revenue
        than
        the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers,
        the
        federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the Canada Health Act; the
        provinces
        can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to
        ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer
        provinces.[246]</p>

    <p> The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their power and
        authority
        from the Constitution Act, 1867, whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament
        of
        Canada.[247] The powers flowing from the Constitution Act, 1867 are divided between the federal government and
        the
        provincial governments to exercise exclusively.[248] As the division of powers between the federal government
        and
        the provinces are defined in the constitution, any changes require a constitutional amendment. The territories,
        being creatures of the federal government, changes to their role and division of powers may be performed
        unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada.[249]</p>

    <p> Canada is the world's tenth-largest economy as of 2018, with a nominal GDP of approximately US$1.73
        trillion.[250]
        It is one of the least corrupt countries in the world,[251] and is one of the world's top ten trading nations,
        with
        a highly globalized economy.[252][253] Canada has a mixed economy ranking above the U.S. and most western
        European
        nations on The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom,[254] and experiencing a relatively low level of
        income disparity.[255] The country's average household disposable income per capita is "well above" the OECD
        average.[256] The Toronto Stock Exchange is the ninth-largest stock exchange in the world by market
        capitalization,
        listing over 1,500 companies with a combined market capitalization of over US$2 trillion.[257]</p>

    <p>In 2018, Canadian trade in goods and services reached CA$1.5 trillion.[258] Canada's exports totalled over CA$585
        billion, while its imported goods were worth over CA$607 billion, of which approximately CA$391 billion
        originated
        from the United States, CA$216 billion from non-U.S. sources.[258] In 2018, Canada had a trade deficit in goods
        of
        CA$22 billion and a trade deficit in services of CA$25 billion.[258]</p>

    <p> Since the early 20th century, the growth of Canada's manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed
        the
        nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized, industrial one.[259] Like many other developed countries,
        the
        Canadian economy is dominated by the service industry, which employs about three-quarters of the country's
        workforce.[260] However, Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of its primary sector, in
        which the forestry and petroleum industries are two of the most prominent components.[261]</p>
    <br>
    <img src="360px-Toronto_(15085972212).jpg" alt="City of Toronto">
    <br>
    <p>Canada's economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II.[263] The
        Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders to trade in the automobile manufacturing
        industry.[264] In the 1970s, concerns over energy self-sufficiency and foreign ownership in the manufacturing
        sectors prompted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government to enact the National Energy Program (NEP)
        and
        the Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA).[265] In the 1980s, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive
        Conservatives abolished the NEP and changed the name of FIRA to Investment Canada, to encourage foreign
        investment.[266] The Canada – United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the
        two
        countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico
        in
        1994 (later replaced by the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement).[267] Canada has a strong cooperative banking
        sector, with the world's highest per-capita membership in credit unions.[268]</p>

    <p> Canada is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of energy.[261][269] Atlantic Canada possesses
        vast offshore deposits of natural gas, and Alberta also hosts large oil and gas resources. The vastness of the
        Athabasca oil sands and other assets results in Canada having a 13 percent share of global oil reserves,
        comprising
        the world's third-largest share after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia.[270] Canada is additionally one of the world's
        largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies are one of the most important global producers
        of
        wheat, canola, and other grains.[271] The federal Department of Natural Resources provides statistics regarding
        its
        major exports; the country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, platinoids, aluminum, steel,
        iron
        ore, coking coal, lead, copper, molybdenum, cobalt, and cadmium.[272] Many towns in northern Canada, where
        agriculture is difficult, are sustainable because of nearby mines or sources of timber. Canada also has a
        sizeable
        manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing
        particularly important industries.[273]</p>

    <p> In 2018, Canada spent approximately CA$34.5 billion on domestic research and development, of which around $7
        billion
        was provided by the federal and provincial governments.[274] As of 2020, the country has produced fifteen Nobel
        laureates in physics, chemistry, and medicine,[275] and was ranked fourth worldwide for scientific research
        quality
        in a major 2012 survey of international scientists.[276] It is furthermore home to the headquarters of a number
        of
        global technology firms.[277] Canada has one of the highest levels of Internet access in the world, with over 33
        million users, equivalent to around 94 percent of its total 2014 population.[278] Canada was ranked 17th in the
        Global Innovation Index in 2019 and 2020.[279][280]</p>

    <p> Some of the most notable scientific developments in Canada include the creation of the modern alkaline
        battery[281]
        and the polio vaccine[282] and discoveries about the interior structure of the atomic nucleus.[283] Other major
        Canadian scientific contributions include the artificial cardiac pacemaker, mapping the visual cortex,[284][285]
        the
        development of the electron microscope,[286][287] plate tectonics, deep learning, multi-touch technology and the
        identification of the first black hole, Cygnus X-1.[288] Canada has a long history of discovery in genetics,
        which
        include stem cells, site-directed mutagenesis, T-cell receptor and the identification of the genes that cause
        Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other
        diseases.[285][289]</p>

    <p> The Canadian Space Agency operates a highly active space program, conducting deep-space, planetary, and aviation
        research, and developing rockets and satellites.[290] Canada was the third country to design and construct a
        satellite after the Soviet Union and the United States, with the 1962 Alouette 1 launch.[291] Canada is a
        participant in the International Space Station (ISS), and is a pioneer in space robotics, having constructed the
        Canadarm, Canadarm2 and Dextre robotic manipulators for the ISS and NASA's Space Shuttle.[292] Since the 1960s,
        Canada's aerospace industry has designed and built numerous marques of satellite, including Radarsat-1 and 2,
        ISIS
        and MOST.[293] Canada has also produced one of the world's most successful and widely used sounding rockets, the
        Black Brant; over 1,000 Black Brants have been launched since the rocket's introduction in 1961.[294]</p>
